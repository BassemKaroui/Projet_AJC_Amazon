       "  'reviewText': 'Star Trek is an exceptional television series in that over the many years it has been broadcast it has managed to bring to wider public attention some of the strangest philosophical and ethical questions imaginable.  Writers had been doing this for years in science fiction novels and short stories but received very little attention for their efforts.  Only a handful of such publications garnered an audience of mass appeal, mainly among college students and becoming referred to as \\'underground\\' classics, i.e. Robert A. Heinlein\\'s \\'Stranger In A Strange Land\\' and similar related titles that are commonly mentioned in the same breath.  The episodes of the classic original series would visit some of those themes in books previously published but it was the follow-up series\\' that would do justice to these ideals that had been a part of a burgeoning sub-culture that was finally reaching its zenith.  Utilizing plot devices and themes seen in the previous TNG episodes like \\'Future Imperfect\\', \\'Elementary, Dear Data\\' and it\\'s follow-up \\'Ship In A Bottle\\', DS9\\'s second season show \\'Shadowplay\\' becomes one of those multiple episodes that demonstrate this.\\n\\nWhile returning from an exploratory mission in the Gamma Quadrant Odo and Dax pause to investigate the mysterious presence of omicron particles.  Tracing it\\'s origins to a nearby planet surface they discover a village; when they beam down to take a closer look they are immediately placed under arrest by the village \\'Protector\\' Colyus.  He informs them that 22 villagers have disappeared without a trace, the most recent one six hours prior to their appearance in the village.  Odo and Dax are cleared as suspects and they offer Colyus their assistance; it isn\\'t long before they discover the source of the conundrum...but that opens up another perplexing problem to sort out as well.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spoil the ending for those who haven\\'t yet seen this show so I won\\'t give away too much. While the story itself isn\\'t much of a mystery it\\'s the question asked in the last act that\\'s more confounding: What is reality?  And how it is answered is what the makes the episode a memorable one.  Wisely, the writers choose to have Odo make the argument and plead the case of the villagers; his character is one in transition, in a constant state of flux: Who am I? Are there any others like myself? What is my real purpose?  And in using him the writers added a genuinely humane touch.  Odo develops a close friendship with one of the children of the village which is what makes him so passionately debate them back into existence.  He also offers a rare parting gift to the child prior to leaving the village.  His character grows just a little softer around his hardened edges here.\\n\\nThere are two other subplots within this show as well - a rarity in Star Trek episodes.  One of them involves Kira visiting Quark after hours in his bar informing him she\\'s keeping an eye on him in Odo\\'s absence.  Another has Jake suffering from an inner conflict: how to tell his father he doesn\\'t want to go to the academy.  Both subplots utilize a storytelling device that juxtaposes what is perceived to be an obvious truth with what the truth actually is.  Hence the title of the episode.  Neither of these is as dramatically interesting as the main storyline but each of them has a worthy moment or two and the final revelation in Kira\\'s suspicions about Quark leads to a great parting line from him.\\n\\nSome final notes: The show\\'s original title was \\'Persistence Of Vision\\' before it was changed in favor of the current one; if that title sounds familiar it should - it was recycled for use as the title of a second season \\'Voyager\\' episode.  Ken Tobey, who plays the pivotal role of \\'Rurigan\\', is better known to film buffs as the veteran actor/star of the 50\\'s classic sci-fi movies \"The Thing (From Another World)\" and \"It Came From Beneath The Sea\".  Kenneth Mars, who plays \\'Colyus\\', is also a recognizable character actor of many feature films, most famously his comic turn in Mel Brooks\\'s cult comedy classic \"The Producers\".  The young girl who plays the villager \\'Taya\\' can also be seen in the fifth season TNG episode \"Imaginary Friend\" as the character \\'Clara Sutter\\'.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Returning to DS9 after a short absence Miles O\\'Brien slowly finds that he has stumbled unto a potential conspiracy that the Federation may or may not be a part of.  As he tries to untangle what he believes is a plot to disrupt an upcoming peace conference, the Chief is constantly diverted and encounters many peculiarities among the crew members.  The conundrum becomes a full blown conspiracy when he is summoned to Odo\\'s office where the DS9 staff officers draw weapons on him and order him to surrender!  I don\\'t want to give away the mystery any more than that, but be certain that you watch this one if you haven\\'t yet.\\nBorrowing liberally from the 1956 sci-fi masterpiece \"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\" and mixing in a small dosage of \"Blade Runner\" and adding just a touch of \"The Manchurian Candidate\", the writers of DS9 create an exceptional mystery.  The political themes and undertones so present in those classic films are retained here as well, injected occasionally building an uncomfortable amount of tension for the Chief to endure.\\nFlashback episodes can be cliched and pedestrian by nature but the Star Trek writers breathe new life into that tiresome vehicle here.  \"Whispers\" is a uniquely filmed episode because O\\'Brien is featured in literally every shot.  Every line of dialogue that is heard in this episode is a conversation that he has with another of the DS9 crew members.  This technique works great for the story as we become totally convinced that O\\'Brien is right to suspect the crew of deception.  Also, the ending of this episode is well constructed - it provides a great twist and a satisfying explanation for the strange happenings.\\nA few notes:  In this show O\\'Brien is referred to as a replicant, the term used in the film \"Blade Runner\".  Wisely, both the Trek creators and writers decided against using the term android which would have caused some small confusion considering it is so closely associated with Data.  Using replicant also works effectively because in \"Blade Runner\" the replicants were on the run - O\\'Brien eventually does too toward the end of the episode.  I\\'ve noticed also that O\\'Brien has to be DS9\\'s most durable and put-upon crew member.  After this ordeal he would suffer through worse personal trials on such episodes as the later \"Tribunal\" and \"Hard Times\".',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Usually I don\\'t enjoy those episodes of the later Star Trek incarnations that draw on past shows from the original series.  But this is one of those rare exceptions where I don\\'t adhere too strongly to that belief.  Reuniting the familiar Kor, Koloth & Kang was a minor stroke of genius by the creative staff and the storyline is first-rate but not executed without flaws.  Some great humor, a heinous and hateful villain plus the dilemma Dax experiences because of her current standing as a Starfleet officer and her recent past as Curzon Dax makes this one of the better DS9 episodes.\\n\\nDiscovering the Klingon that Odo has incarcerated is an old friend named Kor, Dax asks to have him released into her custody.  Soon the two of them meet up with another pair of Klingons, Koloth and Kang, on the DS9 promenade.  The three Klingons have gathered together at the station looking for Curzon Dax so the four of them could carry out a blood oath against a nemesis, the Albino, who killed the three Klingons first-born as an act of vengeance.  Kang has received information from a traitor concerning the whereabouts of their common enemy and is eager to exact revenge.  Both Kang and Koloth refuse to let Jadzia Dax participate because she is both no longer Curzon Dax and a man.  She proves herself to them in a bat\\'leth battle on the holosuite and soon they depart DS9 for the Albino\\'s fortress on a nearby planet.  Dax realizes that something is wrong with their mission and confronts Kang who confesses he has been in contact with the Albino who wants to meet his enemies in battle and a chance for each of them to die with honor.  Because the Albino has too favorable an edge Dax figures a strategy to even the odds, disabling the weaponry at the fortress and allowing the four of them to do hand-to-hand combat with their enemy and his forces.  The fight soon ensues and ends with both victory and tragedy for the quartet.\\n\\nA favorite among fans since it was first seen the credit for the reunion of Classic Trek Klingons goes to series co-producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe.  According to the book \\'The DS9 Companion\\' upon reading writer Peter Allan Fields\\'s story Wolfe suggested to the writer that he use the three Klingons from the original series.  It was a real coup for the show and fans alike that the same three actors were still available and able to recreate their old characters.  Although each of them give fine performances John Calicos as Kor is the most enjoyable and received all the humorous lines of dialogue.  It\\'s a shame he didn\\'t make a return to the station in a later episode.  But as significant as the gathering of these three is the episode still clearly remains focused on the character of Dax.\\n\\nDax experiences another identity crisis and she is set on participating in the blood oath because her principals allow her to see such a violent act as honorable and means that justice will be exacted under Klingon laws.  Sisko reminds her that she is a Starfleet officer, \"What about the laws of the Federation, are you just going to ignore them?\"  When he pushes her further by asking if she\\'ll be ready to suffer the consequences of her actions under Federation law she leaves the station telling Sisko she\\'ll find out if he bring the charges against her.  It is an effective moment but all the same quite a silly one.  Any commanding officer would have placed a subordinate officer under arrest and been done with it.  And when she does return all he does is stare her down.  Only in the movies!  Another small quibble I had with this episode was the absence of the Klingon death howl.  In the ST: TNG episode \\'Heart Of Glory\\' the Klingon death ritual was shown as holding the deceased one\\'s eyes open while the living looked upward and howled, in essence warning the dead that a warrior is about to enter their realm.  Instead one of the Klingons sings.  Maybe there has to be more than one Klingon present for this ritual?  And since when do tetryon particles cause phasers and weaponry to malfunction?  This is the one and only reference to this tactic in the entire Star Trek canon which is amazing since it is so effective when used here!\\n\\nOn the other hand there are other more quietly effective and less unerring moments such as Dax coldly asking Kira about how it felt to her to kill Cardassians during the war.  The bat\\'leth fight between Kang and Dax on the holosuite is done very well.  The final fight sequence at the Albino\\'s fortress has both a great gothic and operatic feel to it; and Dax has a great closing line as her friends lay slain.  But the best line of the show comes in the opening when Quark gets Odo\\'s help in disposing of an unruly Klingon holosuite customer.  It seems the individual refuses to leave and has threatened to kill him if he turns the power off.  At the entrance Odo tells Quark to turn the power off to which the Ferengi exclaims, \"I can\\'t or the Klingon will kill us\".  Odo quickly and correctly points out, \"No.  He said he\\'d kill you.\"  Yet another great and memorable exchange between the two \\'friendly\\' adversaries of DS9.\\n\\nWorth noting:  Michael Ansara who plays Kang here would return for the fourth season episode \\'The Muse\\' as the alien Jeyal.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The name of the game is Chula...and it comes from melding two of the words of a popular children\\'s game called \"Chutes And Ladders\" - no kidding!  The writers of this episode took a close look at several types of games in order to come up with the design for the one played here, hence the name Chula.  \\'Move Along Home\\' is another one of those shows in the Trek catalogue that cause fans to debate its merits.  Though it strays from the course of events that have unfolded in the previous nine episodes it still provides some solid entertainment and manages to create some suspense as well.\\nSisko, Kira, Dax and Bashir prepare to welcome the Wadi, a new alien race from the Gamma Quadrant, to DS9.  Upon arrival the Wadi dispense with the stuffy diplomacy of First Contact and insist they be taken to Quark\\'s Bar so they can play games.  Once there they tempt Quark with some valuable looking gemstones and he escorts them to the Dabo table - immediately.  When the Wadi prove too adept at beating the odds of Dabo, Quark begins cheating them so they will \"stop cutting into his profits.\"  The Wadi\\'s leader Falow catches the Ferengi cheating and challenges him to a game called Chula.  Falow won\\'t tell Quark the rules explaining to him that he has to learn them as he plays the game.  When the two begin their game Sisko, Kira, Dax and Bashir awaken to find themselves trapped in a bizarre and surreal labyrinthine structure.  Jake reports his father is missing to Odo who further finds that the other three officers are also missing.  Soon he and Quark realize that the four game pieces Quark is playing Chula with are representative of the four missing officers and that he may or may not be playing for their survival.\\n\\'Move Along Home\\' is mainly concerned with spotlighting the character of Quark and he is fun to watch throughout the episode, changing from a shrewd businessman into a groveling pathetic mess.  Granted, it is easy for anyone to reason that the Wadi aren\\'t going to bring harm to the four officers but it is reasonably suspenseful and the set design is terrific.  There\\'s plenty of humor scattered throughout as well and both Odo and Kira vent about their uneasy association with the rules and regulations of the Federation.  The story is derivative of an episode of the superior television series \"The Prisoner\" (titled \\'Checkmate\\') where the residents of The Village are used as chess pieces in a chess match.  Chula looks to be quite an intriguing game!  If you took the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, crossed it with Stratego and added a few rudimentary rules of chess you would come close to the game of Chula.  There are a few sly references to Dungeons & Dragons here and if you\\'re familiar with that game you\\'ll pick on them.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Just as The Next Generation did during its inaugural season, DS9 patterned some of its first season entries after successful shows from earlier Trek incarnations.  'If Wishes Were Horses' is a sort of hybrid of plot elements from the episodes 'Shore Leave' from The Original Series and 'The Royale' from TNG.  The story presented here is as entertaining as each of those two and even improves on the formula, incorporating more humor and finding a way to involve all the crewmembers - despite the proud and contrary nature of a select few.\\nAn unusual spatial anomaly appears on the DS9 scanners that can't be identified by the station's science officers. After O'Brien and his wife finish reading the tale of Rumpelstiltskin to their daughter and tuck her into bed she comes out from her bedroom scant moments later telling them that Rumpelstiltskin is in her room.  Naturally disbelieving her they go into her bedroom and find the fairy tale character is quite alive and ready to offer his services.  Earlier in the show's teaser Bashir had confessed to Dax an undying affection for her but she graciously turns him away.  Some time later he is awakened from sleep in his quarters by an unusually vivacious Dax seeking his romantic advances; within a few minutes he will discover that Dax is on the bridge and the one pursuing him is a visage created from his mind.  Adding another twist to the proceedings Jake brings someone to meet his father - the captain's baseball idol Buck Bokai who has been dead for well over 200 years.  During all this the anomaly has become a dangerous rupture in space that threatens to envelope all of Bajoran space destroying everything in the process.  Meanwhile the three new visitors to DS9 prove to be a real conundrum, creating quite a stir attempting to interact with O'Brien, Bashir and both Captain Sisko and Jake.  Eventually their apparitions are tied to the appearance of the spatial anomaly and the captain also discovers the, by now unwelcome, trio's vulnerability that leads to an unexpected resolution.\\nThough the story is heavily influenced by 'Shore Leave', a fan favorite, what's onscreen works marvelously well, making great use of the DS9 denizens and familiar space station areas, providing many humorous moments - especially those involving Odo and Quark who threaten to steal the show entirely in their few scenes.  A snowstorm on the Promenade and later a few emus running about; everyone winning at Dabo on every roll; Quark's mysterious incarceration; the final revelation about the spatial anomaly and many other touches add up to a great mystery that is both fun and absorbing as it unfolds.  In a spirited flourish to the episode when Buck Bokai tempts Jake to forget his homework and come to the holosuite to play ball, an apparition of the captain appears behind Jake's left shoulder acting quite impish enjoying the boy's predicament.  The conversation between Odo and Quark in the show's opener is priceless as well, with Odo insisting that he doesn't have any fantasies as they are a waste of time; we will find out soon enough how grievously wrong that statement is.  In fact none of the DS9 players escapes the lair of their imagination with everyone eventually becoming a victim of sorts.  'If Wishes Were Horses' is an excellent early effort by DS9 and in my humble opinion was of the series most memorable episodes.\",\n",

Of course there were a lot of big name stars  in the cast and I am sure the production cost was huge.'"
